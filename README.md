# Reporting icons ![Report](https://pinguinosyuncafe.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/report-3.png)

- If you want to report icons, please, use the issues page on this following these steps:

1. Add **screenshots** of the missing icon and the instances where it's displayed like: menus, taskbars, panels, notifications, etc.
2. Use the following title prefix (without the quotes): "[Linux] App_name Desktop_environment" - that way we can tag them appropriately.
3. Add the relevant launcher information, software uses files with the extension *.desktop* as launchers for menus like Kickoff, Kicker, Mint menu, Gnome Shell overview, Unity dash, Whisker menu, etc. and these launchers are stored in `/usr/share/applications` (there might be a */kde* or */kde4* folder for KDE apps) for software installed through a package or the package manager. User-installed binaries and Google Chrome apps install their launchers here: `/home/$USER/.local/share/applications/`. Simply open these `.desktop` files with any text editor; copy and paste the line that says `Icon=` to your issue.
4. Add a description of the software, it's very important for us to know what the software does.
